# SMART INTRUDER DETECTION SYSTEM
# Abstract:
	The Smart Intruder Detection System enhances security in restricted areas to  detect and identify intruders, even in dark or low-light condibtions. The system continuously monitors the surroundings using a PIR sensor to detect human motion, an ultrasonic sensor to identify vehicle movement, and a sound sensor to capture unusual acoustic activities. A USB camera is used for real-time face detection when motion or abnormal activity is detected. Upon identifying a potential intruder, the system triggers visual and audio alerts through LEDs and a buzzer, ensuring immediate indication of security threats. By combining sensor data processing with image-based monitoring, the proposed system enhances accuracy, reduces false alarms, and offers a cost-effective, scalable approach for modern security applications in restricted areas.
