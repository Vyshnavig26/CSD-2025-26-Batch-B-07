# SMART INTRUDER DETECTION SYSTEM
# Abstract:
  The Smart Intruder Detection System enhances security in restricted areas by using DL to accurately detect and identify intruders, even in dark or low-light conditions. It leverages skeleton-based analysis along with cameras, PIR, audio, and thermal sensors to minimize false alarms and provide reliable detection. Real-time alerts with images or video are sent to users, while integration with smart devices enables automated responses. Edge AI ensures privacy and efficient data storage. Results demonstrate improved detection accuracy, reduced false alarms, and strengthened protection, highlighting a reliable and intelligent security solution for restricted environments.
